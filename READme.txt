	--- Inspiration is taken from the website in the shared folder.
	--- Not ideally "pixel-perfect" recreation, my ideas are also implemented.

				--- JAVASCRIPT Functionality---
The JS functionality i desided to implement is to dynamicaly update the values of,
the price per kilo (increment and decrement). This also affects the total price in
the bottom. In addition the number can't go bellow 0. It will always be atleast 0. 
Really simple but clean functionality.


				---HTML & CSS---

The style of the page is mostly based on the example website. Some changes are added.
Due to the lack of time, not much JS was related with the HTML & CSS. All the criteria 
is met. Checkout look very simple, yet clean and the design is trendy.


				---Additional Info---
Every asset can be found in this repository. All paths are working and successfully added.
Same colors are repeatedly used throughout the website also the font and patterns.
Every page is easy to navigate and verry straigth forward. User can easly use the website
(not with the current functionality afcorse), but this applies only for the architecture
and navigation.
